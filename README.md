**SIR** model for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus) is currently implemented.

The age and social contact data that is needed to construct structured compartment models can be found at the following sources:

Age structure: Population Pyramid website.

Contact structure: Projecting social contact matrices in 152 countries using contact surveys and demographic data, Kiesha Prem, Alex R. Cook, Mark Jit, PLOS Computational Biology, (2017) DOI, Supporting Information Text and Supporting Information Data.
The stochastic model for this has been added too!
